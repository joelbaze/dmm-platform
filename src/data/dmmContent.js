**The Results:** This shift led to a massive movement. In one instance, a movement grew to over 80,000 churches and millions of baptized believers.

**The Goal:** To finish the Great Commission (Matthew 24:14) by engaging every unreached people group with a movement strategy.`

**CPM (Church Planting Movement):** Often used interchangeably with DMM, but specifically defined as a rapid multiplication of indigenous churches planting churches through at least four generations.

**The Spiritual Firewall:** A filter question to test traditions: "Where do I see this practice in the practices of Jesus or the New Testament church?" If it is not found there, it is discarded to ensure reproducibility.`

**Inclusion (Fishing with a Net):** Reaching the entire family or social circle through a "Person of Peace." The believer remains inside their community to act as "yeast".`
